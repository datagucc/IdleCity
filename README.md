# üå§Ô∏è Idle City Project

## üåç Why this project ?

I grew up and lived in Belgium for a good part of my life, and as beautiful as it is, one thing ended up weighing too heavily: the climate. Not the cold per se, or even the rain, but that combination of constant gray, short, wet, cold days, no light and no snow, stretching on for months. Year after year, I've seen my energy plummet during these periods. It's not just an annoyance - it's a real struggle to stay motivated, creative, and feeling good about myself.

So I decided to do something a little different. A personal project, useful, and deeply aligned with a real life question:
**Where could I really blossom?**
Not just to go off to the sun for a few weeks, but to potentially rebuild everything somewhere else, on better foundations.

I want to make this decision thoughtfully, and with concrete data. So this project will help me analyze several essential aspects:

The weather, of course, first - to identify places where the light and climate suit me.

But also the job market, because you can't live on hot air alone.

The cost of living and purchasing power, to avoid unpleasant surprises.

And accessibility by plane, because staying connected to my roots in Belgium remains important.

This is the kind of project you don't do just for the technicalities, but because it makes sense. And I want to build it properly, like a real data engineering project, with a robust, automated architecture that can be easily reused later.
